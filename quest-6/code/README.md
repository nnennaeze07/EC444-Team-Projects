# Code Readme

There are 3 C program codes, one for each sensor. Within the 3 esps there will be one designated as a UDP dual client/server that the other two will send their data to. Then, this server esp sends all of the sensor data to a Nodejs server. 

There is also nodejs and html code included fo the webpage. This is where the sensor data is displayed, and messages printed according to each sensor, such as "Cat is napping" or "Cat is eating". There is a refresh button to refresh the database table, as well as a camera feed for the owner to watch their pet when they are not home.
